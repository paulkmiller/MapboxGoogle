## Hi! I'm...

* Not Paul Miller
* I'm definitenly not a Web Developer at [Greater Washington Publishing](http://gwp2.herokuapp.com/).
* Don't even try emailing me at: [pmiller@gwpi.net](mailto:pmiller@gwpi.net).
* I *swear* if you even go so far as get within 5 miles of my [portfolio site](http://paul-miller.herokuapp.com/), I'll punch my cat.

*   Do some thing
*   Raise some roofs
*   Get Rich Quick in These 9 easy payments of $1mil/yr!

## Administrivia

## Course Updates

*   [codeacademy](http://codeacademy.com)
*   You should have gotten an email with an access code
*   We will post assignments, handouts and updates there
*   You'll turn in your homework as zip files there

--

## What we're going to learn
(really)

*   \#1 priority is learning to find your own answers!
*   But in concrete terms, how to start a website from scratch.
*   Create semantically meaningful HTML pages
*   Style them (mostly) to your liking using CSS
*   At _least_ be able to find, understand and apply pre-written javascript interaction to your pages with aplomb!

--

## Don't expect to learn...

*   We're not doing any back-end stuff, though we are more than happy to answer specific questions.
*   That means no WordPress, Drupal, Ruby on Rails, Node, etc.

--

## Class Environment

*   Ask us lots of questions!
*   Ask each other lots of questions!
*   Let's keep it light.

## Intro To Web Development


---

## What is Web Development?

--

## What is Web Development?

* The practice of creating applications and experiences that users interact with via the World Wide Web.
* Most often, the act of turning ideas and design compositions into a real, usable website.
* Made up of many smaller disciplines, but primarily two...

---

## Front-End Web Development

**Client-Side**

The _client_ is the application the end-user runs to use your website.
In most cases, a web browser such as Chrome or Firefox, but there are tons of possible clients out there!

* Mobile browsers
* A [Pizza button](http://piepal.me/)
* A [Toothbrush?](http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2014/01/06/260189445/ces-2014-toothbrush-bed-car-put-some-internet-on-it)
* Others?

Note:
* Mobile phone
* Screen readers for the disabled
* Scrapers (Open data, etc)
* A search bot (Crawlers for Google, Yahoo!, etc.)
* A Roku or other consumer web-enabled device

--

## The web works everywhere

And this is why it is awesome.

Note:
Front-end is all about keeping the 'everywhere' in mind, and making the best
experience possible in every context.

--

## Front-End Web Development Languages

*   HTML
*   CSS
*   JavaScript

Note:
* Each of these languages has abstractions that make them more powerful, or more like "familiar" backend languages:
  HAML, SASS, CoffeeScript.
* Some people love them, some people hate them.

---

## Back-End Web Development

**Server-Side**

The _server_ is the thing that handles the requests coming from your client. Back-end code runs only on the server, and responds in languages the client understands.

Note:
Every web page meant for public use needs a server, but that doesn't necessarily mean server-side coding.

--

## Back-End Web Development Languages

*   Ruby   ([Ruby on Rails][1], [Sinatra][2], [Padrino][3])
*   PHP    ([WordPress][4], [Drupal][5], [Laravel][6])
*   Python ([Django][7], [Flask][8])
*   PERL   ([Movable Type][9])
*   C++    ([.NET][10])
*   A bajillion others!

## Do You _Need_ a Back End?

**Nope!** Some websites are _static_, meaning there's no back-end development at all - the server just responds with exactly the files that were requested.

Note:
This is where we're gonna be hanging out - you can do a lot with just front-end code, especially with all the 3rd party APIs out there nowadays.

## The Whole Process

From Idea to Deployment

--

## Research

*   User interviews
*   Bucketing / Themes
*   Frameworks & Synthesis
*   Brainstorming

Resource:
[IDEO's Human-Centered Design Toolkit](http://books.ideo.com/)

--

## Research Alternatives

*   Fabricated User Personas / Scenarios
*   User Surveys
*   Focus Groups

Note:
Not every budget allows for travel, pay for interviewees, tons of time spent on the ideo process

--

## UX Design / Prototyping

*   Prototypes are models of an interaction or the process to complete a task
*   Validate against user needs / scenarios
*   Low-fi vs Hi-fi
    *   Sketches on paper vs. Barebones, "fake" web pages
    *   Test in "meatspace" first
*   Iterate!

Resource: [UIE Articles Archive](http://www.uie.com/articles)

Note:
* You can prototype like playing chess: draw, interact, repeat.
* Let's try it in class (time permitting), with a FB mobile chat exercise.

--

## Information Architecture

*   How content is organized
*   Structure & Hierarchy
*   Sitemaps, Wireframes
*   Informed by lessons learned from prototype phase

* [OmniGraffle (Mac, $50)](http://omnigroup.com/omnigraffle)
* [EightShapes Unify (InDesign)](http://unify.eightshapes.com)
* [Balsamiq (Cross-platform, $80)](http://balsamiq.com)
* [UXPin (Cloud, $15/mo)](http://uxpin.com)


--

## Visual Design

*   What it actually looks like
*   Branding, User Interface elements, Colors
*   Design systems are more flexible than one-offs

* Laura Kalbag: [Design Systems](http://24ways.org/2012/design-systems/)

## Front-End Development

*   Turning PSDs into \*real\* web pages
*   HTML structure, styles, JavaScript interactions

Resources:

* [Macaw](http://macaw.co)
* [Adobe Edge](http://html.adobe.com/edge/)
* This Class!

--

## Back-End Development

*   Customizing the experience to the individual user
*   User accounts, Data & payment submission, Saved data
*   Anything dealing with information that can't be sent to "everyone"

Resource: [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com)

--

## Deployment

*   Putting your code on a "production" server
*   Makes your site available to the public
*   DNS (Domain Name System) configuration maps your domain to your server
*   Can be as simple as copying files to a folder with FTP,
*   Or as complicated as a scripted process with database migrations, dependency installation, etc.

Resources:

* 80s Music  
* Hard Drugs

## Homework

* Watch [this video](http://www.dontfeartheinternet.com/the-basics/not-tubes) about the Internet.
* Read [this article](http://www.theguardian.com/help/insideguardian/2009/sep/28/blogpost) about web development.
