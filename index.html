                    <li>Google Maps is the winner for 99% of use cases</li>
                    <li>2500 map views for free, charged $0.50 USD per 1,000 additional requests up to 100,000 requests per API per day</li>
                    <li>Accuracy— Google has access to huge data streams that no ordinary company can afford to access. E.G. ETA is a function of numerous variables like terrain information, average speed data, real time traffic data, weather etc.</li>
                    <li>Associated Services; Google Maps API is keyed into services such as Places, Business, Streetview, Satellite Imagery, Autocomplete, Google Earth etc.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/">Good Documentation</a> - vastly more organized & current than Mapbox docs</li>

                <ul class="bullets">
                    <li>Not very flexible with integrating external API’s ( D3.js or Angular, though it can be done, is a pain )</li>
                    <li>The value of proprietary map data is approaching zero
                        <br>
                        <br>Nokia for example bought <a href="https://maps.here.com/?map=38.8251,-90.7289,10,normal">HERE</a> for $8 Billion, recently sold for $3 Billion, i.e. open-source map data is winning against proprietary data, giving the upper hand
                        to open-source now & in the future.
                        <br>
                        <br> This calls into question their current pricing structure, along with how they proceed, as the true value of map data continues to fall.</li>

                <ul class="bullets">
                    <li>"I'm currently going with Google Maps, though I'm not happy about the decision. Getting any kind of custom HTML for markers/tool tips is absolutely the worst part of my React codebase (and I use "React" loosely because of it). It's
                        spaghetti callbacks sprinkled with anonymous
                        < div/> traversal.
                        <br>

                    <li>Built using OSM
                        <br><span>( hallmark is customization & malleability, maintained by ~2mil members )<span></li>
              <li>API is Developers Choice</li>
              <li>Tech Support</li>
              <li>Easy-To-Use GUI ( Map Studio ) for making Custom Maps / Vectors / Data Visualizations / Injecting Custom SVG’s & Data into existing map styles</li>
              <li>Uses WebGL tech, making the animations / loading very smooth</li>
              <li>Visually stands-out and very appealing</li>
              <li>If used, we'll likely <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/pricing/">need to pay</a> for Premium ( $499/mo ) or Enterprise ( Must Contact Them ); Aside from ancilliary bonuses, Premium offers High-Priority email assistance, meaning our questions will be answered well before many others. Enterprise grants us a dedicated Mapbox dev that will act as our point-of-contact if we ever need tech assistance with Mapbox. </li>
              <li>Cluster <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/cluster/" target="_blank"> Documentation</a> and a<a href="
https://www.mapbox.com/blog/supercluster/" target="_blank"> Blog</a> talking specifically about it readily available</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Con's</h3>
            <ul class="bullets">
              <li>Will need very specialized design and data goals & needs to justify omitting Google Maps as a solution over Mapbox</li>
              <li>Documentation is either exactly right or out of date; depends on which library you use. Mapbox GL has an extensive examples library with code and previews, bringing dev overhead down, but other services ( like the studio ) has limited documentation</li>
              <li>Can be difficult to discern what needs to be configured in code and what needs to be done in the Map Stuio</li>
              <li>Though OSM is a hallmark of Mapbox as a service, tensions may lead to a fractured relationship; future unclear. Read this excellent <a href="http://www.citylab.com/design/2015/06/who-owns-the-digital-map-of-the-world/396119/">City Lab</a> article for more details.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Arguably Good or Bad</h3>
            <ul class="bullets">
                <li>When visualizing data as Tilesets, you upload your .mkv or .csv through Mapbox Studio, then begin giving styles to that data-layer via the stuio. This means that every layer that needs to be visualized is created, our data must then be hosted via Mapbox in order for the data-layering and associated styles to work. Their Premium plan offers up to 50gb with their Enterprise giving Unlimited, however Danny's presumption is we'll never move past the 10gb mark in mapping data, if that.</li>
                <li>50,000 views/month for $50 w/ 3 custom styles : how many views will be needed given our traffic is yet to be determined.</li>
                <li>Direct and arguably sole competitor of Google Maps due to it's configurable nature</li>
