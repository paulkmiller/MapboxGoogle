                <ul class="bullets">
                    <li>Google Maps is the winner for 99% of use cases</li>
                    <li>2500 map views for free, charged $0.50 USD per 1,000 additional requests up to 100,000 requests per API per day</li>
                    <li>Accuracy— Google has access to huge data streams that no ordinary company can afford to access. E.G. ETA is a function of numerous variables like terrain information, average speed data, real time traffic data, weather etc.</li>
                    <li>Associated Services; Google Maps API is keyed into services such as Places, Business, Streetview, Satellite Imagery, Autocomplete, Google Earth etc.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/">Good Documentation</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/">Large Selection of Examples</a></li>
                    <li>Easily Configurable</li>

                <h3>Con's</h3>
                <ul class="bullets">
                    <li>Not very flexible with integrating external API’s ( D3.js or Angular, though it can be done, is a pain )</li>
                    <li>The value of proprietary map data is approaching zero
                        <br>
                        <br>Nokia for example bought <a href="https://maps.here.com/?map=38.8251,-90.7289,10,normal">HERE</a> for $8 Billion, recently sold for $3 Billion, i.e. open-source map data is winning against proprietary data, giving the upper hand
                        to open-source now & in the future.
                        <br>
                        <br> This calls into question their current pricing structure, along with how they proceed, as the true value of map data continues to fall.</li>

                <h3>Pro's</h3>
                <ul class="bullets">
                    <li>Built using OSM
                        <br><span>( hallmark is customization & malleability, maintained by ~2mil members )<span></li>
              <li>API is Developers Choice</li>
              <li>Tech Support</li>
              <li>Easy-To-Use GUI ( Map Studio ) for making Custom Maps / Vectors / Data Visualizations / Injecting Custom SVG’s & Data into existing map styles</li>
              <li>Uses WebGL tech, making the animations / loading very smooth</li>
              <li>Visually stands-out and very appealing</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Con's</h3>
            <ul class="bullets">
              <li>Will need very specialized design and data goals & needs to justify omitting Google Maps as a solution over Mapbox</li>
              <li>Documentation is either exactly right or out of date; depends on which library you use. Mapbox GL has an extensive examples library with code and previews, bringing dev overhead down, but other services ( like the studio ) has limited documentation</li>
              <li>Can be difficult to discern what needs to be configured in code and what needs to be done in the Map Stuio</li>
              <li>Though OSM is a hallmark of Mapbox as a service, tensions may lead to a fractured relationship; future unclear. Read this excellent <a href="http://www.citylab.com/design/2015/06/who-owns-the-digital-map-of-the-world/396119/">City Lab</a> article for more details.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Arguably Good or Bad</h3>
            <ul class="bullets">
                <li> 50,000 views/month for $50 w/ 3 custom styles </li>
                <li>Direct and arguably sole competitor of Google Maps due to it's configurable nature</li>
